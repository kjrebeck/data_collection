# Mars News and Weather Data Analysis

This project involves a full web-scraping and data analysis. Data was scraped from a Mars news website (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and a Mars weather data site(https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html), the collected data was then analyzed and visualized. 
The skills utilized in this project include:

### Programming in Python:
- Writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
- Utilizing libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Web Scraping:
- Identifying HTML elements on a webpage.
- Using automated browsing tools like Splinter.
- Parsing HTML with Beautiful Soup to extract data.

### Data Storage and Organization:
- Storing scraped data in Python data structures, such as dictionaries and lists.
- Exporting data to JSON and CSV files for sharing and further analysis.
- Using Pandas to create and manipulate DataFrames.
- Casting data to appropriate types (e.g., datetime, int, float).

### Data Visualization:
- Creating visual representations of data using Matplotlib.
- Plotting bar charts to illustrate trends and findings.

### Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking:
- Inspecting web pages to determine the structure and elements to scrape.
- Analyzing data to draw meaningful insights and conclusions.
- Debugging and troubleshooting issues that arise during web scraping and data analysis.


## Deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: 
- A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.

### Deliverable 2:
- A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.
